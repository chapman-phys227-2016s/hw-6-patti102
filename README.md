# PHYS227 HW 6

**Author:** Taylor Patti

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-phys227-2016s/hw-6-patti102.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-phys227-2016s/hw-6-patti102)

**Due date:** 2016/03/17

## Specification

**Hints:** For tests involving plots, use your Jupyter notebook instead of the nosetests framework. Solve each problem in two ways: 1) with numpy numerically, and 2) with sympy symbolically.

Complete the following exercises from the primary textbook, placing your solutions into separate files. In each file, write the solution as a callable function, so that you can write suitable test functions that demonstrate correct output using the nose framework. GitHub will automatically run your tests on every commit, indicating any failures via the Travis framework with build status above.

1. Exercise C.3 (```yx_ODE.py```)
1. Exercise C.4 (```unstable_ODE.py```) 

Finally, to cleanly present your work, create a Jupyter notebook ```hw6.ipynb``` that imports each of your python files as modules and demonstrates the functionality. The notebook should be formatted professionally using Markdown headings, including your name and a brief description of each homework section.

## Assessment

This was a fun one. The appendix could have been more explicit about the general structure of Euler's method. Also, it didn't include any info on solving DiffEq's symbolically, so that wasn't too much help either. The actual problems were fun though.

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

I looked up how to use sympy to solve DiffEq's online as I couldn't find it in the book.

Signed,

Taylor Patti
